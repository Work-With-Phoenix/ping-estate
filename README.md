 Ping Estate Template
</h1>

## ðŸ‘€ Introduction

1.  **What's this?**

    The following repository is a template model created for education purposes or inspiration. The template is created from a design I got on *Pinterest* which directed me to *Dribbble* there was a lot of tabs open that day.
          

2.  **Download the project**
    
    The project is meant to be for anyone who would like to have a feel of what a project created by both *Gatsby* & *Tailwind* looks like. Once you clone or download the project from the repo, follow the steps highlighted below to get your project set up.
    ```shell
    # clone the ping estate template project  repository
    git clone -b main https://github.com/Work-With-Phoenix/ping-estate
    ```

3.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    #copy it to a project dir of your choice
    cp -r ping-estate

    #go to the new directory
    cd my-project

    #install packages
    npm install

    #run server
    gatsby develop 
    ```

4.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Runs the app in the development mode.
    Open http://localhost:8000 to view it in your browser.

    The page will reload when you make changes.
    You may also see any lint errors in the console.
